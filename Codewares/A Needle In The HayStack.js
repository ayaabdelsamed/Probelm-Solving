//Can you find the needle in the haystack?
//Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"
//After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

function findNeedle(haystack) {
    return 'found the needle at position'+ haystack.indexOf('needle')
}
